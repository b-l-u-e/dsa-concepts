# Queues

- Queue is an ordered list of elements where an element is insterted at the end of the queue and is removed from the front of the queue.

- Works based on First in, First Out (FIFO).

- A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing linear data structures.

- add = enqueue, offer()
- remove = dequeue, poll()
- examine = peek()

## **Purpose of using stacks**

1: Keyboard buffer (letters should appear on the screen in the order they are pressed)

2: Printer queue (print jobs should be completed in order)

3: Used in LinkedLists, PriorityQueues, Breadth-first search

## Priority Queue

- A FIFO data structure that serves elements with the highest priorities first before elements with the lowest priority
