# Stacks

- A stack is an abstract data type and a linear data structure from which we remove only the most recent element added.

- Store objects into a sort of "Vertical tower"

- use `push()` to add items to the top of the stack

- use `pop()` to remove items from the top of the stack



## **Key Principles:**

1: Last-in, First-out (LIFO) or First-in, Last-out (FILO): The last element you put into the structure will always be the first item to come out

2: Need to follow LIFO principle therefore, a stack is a good example of limited-access data structure

## **Purpose of using stacks**

1: undo/redo features in text editors

2: moving back/forward through browser history

3: backtracking algorithms (maze, file directories)

4: calling functions (call stack)
